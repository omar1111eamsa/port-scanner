# **Port Scanner**

## 📌 **Description**

This project is a **simple Python Port Scanner** that scans a given IP address for **open ports** within a specified range. It uses the **socket library** to attempt connections and identifies common services running on open ports.

---

## 🛠 **Features**

✔ **Scans a target IP** for open ports  
✔ **Identifies services** running on open ports (if known)  
✔ **Uses a timeout** to avoid long waits  
✔ **Improved error handling** to prevent crashes  
✔ **Simple and lightweight**  

---

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### 1️⃣ **Run the script**

\`\`\`sh
python port_scanner.py
\`\`\`

### 2️⃣ **Provide user inputs:**  

- **Enter the target IP address**  
- **Enter the start port**  
- **Enter the end port**  

The script will scan the specified port range and **display open ports with their corresponding services**.

---

## 📂 **Example Output**

\`\`\`
Give the IP address of the target:
127.0.0.1
What is the Start Port:
50
What is the End Port:
10000
Scanning 127.0.0.1 from port 50 to 10000...
[+] Port 80 is open (http)
Scan complete!
\`\`\`

## 🔥 **New Improvements in This Version**

✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**  

- **Invalid IP Address Handling:** Prevents scanning if the IP/hostname is incorrect  
- **Port Range Validation:** Ensures user inputs are between \`0 - 65535\`  
- **Timeout Handling:** Avoids long wait times on unresponsive ports  
- **Unexpected Errors:** Catches exceptions and prevents script crashes  

✅ **Fixed Typo in Input Prompt**  

- \`"What is the End Prot :"\` → \`"What is the End Port :"\`

## 🔥 **Recent Update**  

✅ **Multithreading for Faster Scanning**  

The script now performs **concurrent scanning** using multithreading to scan multiple ports simultaneously, significantly improving performance and reducing scan times.

---

## 🎯 **Future Improvements**

🔹 **Save scan results** to a file for later analysis.  
🔹 **Improve user interface** with a progress bar.  
🔹 **Add custom error handling for different network conditions.**
